leftoff: when player spawn, location is wrong. Could be Player scene or location. 
Try spawning just a circle to see if that fixes it, then it's the Player scene that needs to be fixed

Todo:
	- remove player from seat on disconnect
	- allow player to click on seat number to swap
	- start "ready" button
	- when all players are in "ready" state", tell all client to disable seat selection and ready button
	- then, start card dealing
