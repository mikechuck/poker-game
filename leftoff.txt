leftoff: 
	- started "game start" logic
	- started adding logic for cash amounts. hook up player card money to actual data
	- once this data is displayed, then integrate the bet button against it
	- when we have all game buttons hooked up to game_manager, start ACTUAL game logic (dealing, turn based system, etc)

Todo:
	- Add "is server" checks to rpc functions
	- Maybe try to split out client and server code more?
	- show list of connected players in room
	- when all players are in "ready" state", host can select "start" button which tells all client to disable seat selection and ready button
	- Connect things to the game_started_event signal, deal cards, change UI to in-game ui, etc etc etc
